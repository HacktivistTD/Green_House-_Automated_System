# Green_House-_Automated_System
ðŸŒ± Greenhouse Controller with AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection, pH, and Moisture Monitoring


This project is a smart IoT-based greenhouse management system that integrates:

AI-driven crop disease detection using a trained machine learning model.
pH monitoring and automatic control to maintain optimal soil conditions.
Soil moisture sensing and automated irrigation to optimize water usage.
Real-time sensor data monitoring via Firebase/MQTT.
Web dashboard (React + Firebase) for remote control and visualization.
ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Crop Disease Detection: Uses an ESP32-CAM or Raspberry Pi camera to capture plant images, analyze them with an ML model, and provide disease classification & recommendations.
âœ… Automated pH Control: Monitors soil pH and adjusts acidity/alkalinity using a solenoid valve-based liquid dispenser.
âœ… Soil Moisture Monitoring & Irrigation: Detects moisture levels and activates a water pump when needed.
âœ… Temperature & Humidity Sensing: Ensures optimal greenhouse climate control.
âœ… Cloud Connectivity: Sends real-time sensor data to Firebase and allows remote access.
